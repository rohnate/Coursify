 - You do NOT clone when you already have a local project.
    You add the remote instead.
        Cloning is only for empty folders.
    If the remote repo on git has some files, then you have to pull them first.

- dotenv is loaded once, in the main file only then can called anywhere. npm install dotenv


Q - What is Router in Express ?

Ans - Imagine you put all routes in `index.js`:

        ```js
        app.get("/login", ...)
        app.post("/signup", ...)
        app.get("/courses", ...)
        app.post("/courses", ...)
        app.delete("/courses/:id", ...)
        ```

        😵 File becomes huge and messy.

        👉 Router helps you split routes into small files.

        ## What is a router? (simple definition)

        > A router is like a mini Express app that handles routes for a specific feature.

        Think:

        * `app` → whole application
        * `router` → one section (users, courses, auth)

        ---

        ## Basic router example

        `routes/user.routes.js`

        ```js
        const express = require("express");
        const router = express.Router();

        router.post("/signup", (req, res) => {
        res.send("User signup");
        });

        router.post("/login", (req, res) => {
        res.send("User login");
        });

        module.exports = router;
        ```

        ---

        ## Using router in main file

        `index.js`

        ```js
        const express = require("express");
        const app = express();

        const userRouter = require("./routes/user.routes");

        app.use("/users", userRouter);

        app.listen(3000);
        ```

        ---

        ## How URLs are formed (important!)

        ```js
        app.use("/users", userRouter);
        ```

        Inside router:

        ```js
        router.post("/login", ...)
        ```

        ➡ Final URL:

        ```
        POST /users/login
        ```

        ---

        ## Why router is IMPORTANT (big reasons)

        1️⃣ Clean code

        Each feature has its own file.

        2️⃣ Easy to scale

        Add new routes without touching main file.

        3️⃣ Team-friendly

        Multiple devs can work on different routers.

        4️⃣ Middleware support

        You can add middleware to router only.

        ---

        ## Router with middleware (very useful)

        ```js
        router.use(authMiddleware);

        router.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
        res.send("Protected profile");
        });
        ```

        Only this router is protected 🔐

        ---

        ## Folder structure (recommended)

        ```
        src
        ├── index.js
        ├── routes
        │   ├── user.routes.js
        │   ├── course.routes.js
        │   └── admin.routes.js
        ├── controllers
        └── models
        ```
        - It just connects URL → logic.
